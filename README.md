# myday-health-streamlit
This GitHub repo is the streamlit application which generates the Snowhealth app.

### Demo Usage 
To properly use this demo you must provide a model name via the URL like here (https://snowhealth.streamlitapp.com/?model=YOUR_MODEL_NAME). This name will propigate to the various Steamlit pages and eventually Snowflake.

The Snowflake created UDF will also this name - use a unique name otherwise you will be over writing an existing model.
